### Hi!

My name is Maciej. I'm currently studying Applied CS @ AGH UST. 

I've been working @Enso for quite some time, then I've co-founded Get Care Today.

My passion is writing projects, where I can discover new languages or technologies.

I'm mostly keen to code in Scala or Swift, nevertheless writing in C# or Java is still a great pleasure for me.

(This readme is WIP - just like some side projects tbh)
